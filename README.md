## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @benjohnson

Iâ€™m a Software Lead and Architect from Canada. I'm currently at [Prodigy](https://prodigygame.com), building software to help kids learn math and caring for the humans who do so.

Iâ€™m into design (software and visual), amazing user experiences, coffee, pizza, adorable pictures of animals, and oxford commas.

I write about my software, the world, and my kiddo at [benjohnson.ca](https://benjohnson.ca).
